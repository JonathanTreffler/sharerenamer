# Files Share Link Renamer
###A simple and fast share link renamer add-in for Files app in ownCloud Server 8 and 9 


This is an add-in to the Files app, which allows you to customize your share tokens, so your links can be https://cloud.ex/s/bachelorparty instead of https://cloud.ex/s/qPv1SwbU5M2YEoJZ. Just share a file or folder (or click an already shared one) and a new button will appear below the share link URL in the sidebar of the Files app.

The translations are from the Files app too, so this app is translated to every language the Files app is translated to.
